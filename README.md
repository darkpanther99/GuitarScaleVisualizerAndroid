# GuitarScaleVisualizerAndroid
An earlier java desktop project of mine, remade in kotlin, as an Android application.  
The java project can also be found on my github <a href="https://github.com/darkpanther99/Guitar-Scale-Visualizer" >here</a>  
  
  
You can run the project on an Android emulator, but it works on real Android phones as well.  
The minimum Android SDK version to run it is 21 (Android 5.0, Lollipop)  
The targeted Android SDK verion is 29 (Android 10)
