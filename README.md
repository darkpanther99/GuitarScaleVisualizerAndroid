# GuitarScaleVisualizerAndroid
An earlier java desktop project of mine, remade in kotlin, as an Android application.  
The java project can also be found on my github <a href="https://github.com/darkpanther99/Guitar-Scale-Visualizer" >here</a>  
  
The goal of this app is to help guitarists find scales on the fretboard while soloing.  
It utilizes the Fragment technology of the Android system, so it works especially well on Android tablets.  
  
  
You can run the project on an Android emulator, but it works on real Android phones as well.  
The minimum Android SDK version to run it is 21 (Android 5.0, Lollipop)  
The targeted Android SDK verion is 29 (Android 10)  

It supports English and Hungarian languages.  
You can also use it in night mode, however the UI colors need a bit of refactoring there.
